 Out of all of the coding languages out there, let's just say that Stata is no my favorite. I don't wanna trash on the program as I know many very intellegent people who use it, but there are limitations that ought to be aknowleged, especially after you've gone from using R or Python to Stata. Feels a bit like going from Windows 11 to Windows 8. 
 
 It's a loose-loose situation. 
 
BUT. You should be familier enough with Stata to pass codeing tasks if you're in the application phase for research positions or predoctoral fellowship positions. Hence this blog post. 

 Let's go over a couple of basic code and code layouts for those who are completley new and despite using all of the forums and Chat GBT, still are running into problems.
