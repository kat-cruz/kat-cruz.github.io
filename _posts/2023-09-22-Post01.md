Welp, first blog post here! I never, *ever* imagined myself as the blogger type - mainly because I feel like I'm a bit too cynical - much too sarcastic, really - to be writing a blog. 

I also, despite my dreams of being a spelling bee, haven't cracked to code on grammar and spelling correctly, which may have limited my writing to a certain extent. 
So yes, while I'm taking the great dare to blog, I'm not here to discuss my favorite vegan gluten-free sugar-free - happiness-free really - recipe, or review an obscure makeup item you didn't know you didn't need - nay, I'm here to talk economics, politics, science, and bizarre mixture of the three complimented with an extra je ne sais quoi that will keep things *spicy*. 

You're welcome to join along for the ride of pursuing life's greatest mysteries with me, and given data availability, what some of that may translate to in numbers, in tangible, undeniable facts. 

I would say buckle up, but as a cynic I don't believe in seat belts, or anything really, save for the power of God and bleach (the only cleaning product I trust.)
