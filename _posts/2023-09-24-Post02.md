In macro econ, all young, impressionable economists learn neo-classic economics where economists whisper the magic
"*certiu paribus*" to look at a couple of variables and plug them into a model. The first of such models is 
the Solow Growth Model, often used to help frame a question or form a theory before using data to prove or disprove the model. 

The standard production function looks like this: 

$$ Y = F(K,L) = AK^{\alpha}L^{1-\alpha} $$

where 
- A = total factor productivity,
- K = capital,
- L = Labor,

and $\alpha$ and $1-\alpha$ describe the capital and labor share of income, respectively. For the rest of this blog, I'll let $/beta = 1 - \alpha$. The cool thing about having a nice, clean equation is 
the easy algebraic manipulation that lets us isolate variables and put them in different functional forms. Solow Given a viable data set, we can estimate the exponents by taking the natural log of each variable and
then its derivative, like so: 

$$ ln(Y) = ln(A) + \alpha ln(K) + \beta ln(L)$$

and this yields a linear function, which makes our lives significantly easier. Taking the derivative, we now have

$$ \implies \frac{\delta}{\delta Y}ln(Y) =  \alpha \frac{\delta}{\delta K} ln(K) + \beta \frac{\delta}{\delta L} ln(L)$$

and solving for $\alpha$, we have:
