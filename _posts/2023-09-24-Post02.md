That's how I referred to the model in uni anyways. 

In macro econ, all young, impressionable economists learn neo-classic economics where economists whisper the magic
*ceteris paribus* to look at a couple of variables and plug them into a model. The first of such models is 
the Cobb-Douglas Model, which is considered in some ways the foundation of macroeconomics, similar to how the Pythagorean theorem is revered in math. 

The standard production function looks like this: 

$$ Y = F(K,L) = AK^{\alpha}L^{1-\alpha} $$

where 
- $A$ = total factor productivity,
- $K$ = capital,
- $L$ = Labor,

and \[\alpha\] and $1-\alpha$ describe the capital and labor share of income, respectively. For the rest of this blog, I'll let $\beta = 1 - \alpha$. The cool thing about having a nice, clean equation is 
the easy algebraic manipulation that lets us isolate variables and put them in different functional forms. Solow Given a viable data set, we can estimate the exponents by taking the natural log of each variable and
then its derivative, like so: 

$$ ln(Y) = ln(A) + \alpha ln(K) + \beta ln(L) $$

and this yields a linear function, which makes our lives significantly easier. Taking the derivative, we now have

$$ \implies \frac{\delta}{\delta Y}ln(Y) =  \alpha \frac{\delta}{\delta K} ln(K) + \beta \frac{\delta}{\delta L} ln(L)$$

and running a regression with these factors ought to provide $\alpha$ and $\beta$. 

What I don't understand is how we can actually find these coefficients. As seen above, there's a certain amount of back-solving required to estimate these exponents - first run a regression that uses the growth rate of these variables which would yield coefficients for both K and L, but it's nearly unrealistic to believe these would add to one (constant returns to scale) or give us accurate estimates because these coefficients are not attained in the functions regular form. In other words, using the *rate* of capital and labor to estimate *accurately* the share of capital and labor is really hard to do even with really nice data. 

For all the convenience that these models offer regarding theory, they don't translate into accurate storytelling when using data. The problem becomes then, what do we sacrifice? Nice modeling that provides an interesting story, but inaccurate estimates, or accurate data in the form of a billion regression tables, but lacks storytelling? 

Basically, as with every other question ever posed in economics, I think the answer probably lies somewhere in the middle and widely depends on what is being researched.
